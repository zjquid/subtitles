1
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,770
We rub shoulders with each other every day.
 
2
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,740
We may not know each other...

3
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,370
but we may become good friends someday.

4
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,410
My name is He Qiwu,
I'm a cop and 223 is my number.

5
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,140
Freeze!

6
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,870
At the closest point of our intimacy...

7
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,180
we were just 0.01 cm from each other.

8
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,020
Fifty-seven hours later,

9
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,560
I fell in love with this woman.

10
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,770
Auntie? This is Wu.

11
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,610
Just want to say hi... Yes, to you, not to May.

12
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,030
Long time no see, how are you?

13
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,430
I'm fine... Yeah, I think... it's better
to let May cool down a little first.

14
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm sure she'll call me later.

15
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,210
No, don't tell her that I called.

16
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,800
You're going to a movie now?

17
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,970
I'll let you go. Is Uncle there?

18
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,940
Uncle? This is Wu.

19
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,450
Just want to say hi... How's your cough?

20
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,960
What?

21
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,790
You're going to a movie with Auntie?
I won't hold you then.

22
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,920
Is May's sister there?

23
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,790
No? Send her my regards.

24
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,300
We all develop our own habits,

25
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,930
mine is waiting here for May to get off from work.

26
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,480
May likes this place because the manager says
she looks like Demi Moore.

27
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,430
She and I just broke up.

28
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,230
May said that I had become more and more
unlike Bruce Willis.

29
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,400
Any message for account 368?

30
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,900
"Love you a million years.”

31
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,450
Ming paged? Do you mean May?

32
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,530
Spell it for me. Is it Ming or May?

33
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,800
You're sure you didn't make a mistake?

34
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,550
Don't you know English?

35
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,900
Ming? Did May ask you to page me?

36
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,690
I'm fine, Tell her not to worry.

37
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,950
I'll take good care of myself.

38
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,920
She can call me any time she wants,

39
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,870
we don't need you as a go-between.

40
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
You mean she didn't ask you to page me?

41
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,330
So what's this for?

42
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,930
Go jogging?
Have you fallen out of love again?

43
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,090
Why do I have to jog with you?

44
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
What? A contest?

45
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,730
You know that jogging is very personal,
how can you possibly let others see you jog?

46
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,940
Go to bed.

47
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,780
We all have our moments with a broken heart.

48
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,780
Every time I've fallen out of love, I'll go jogging.

49
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,790
Jogging helps to evaporate water
from the body...

50
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,340
so that there won’t be any left for tears.

51
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,740
How can I possibly shed tears?

52
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,880
To May,

53
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,250
I'm the cool guy.

54
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,360
Still fighting with your girlfriend?
It's been almost a month!

55
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,390
Get another one.

56
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,860
Why don't you try May? She's cool.

57
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,150
Hello.

58
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,630
She's getting off early tonight,
go date her.

59
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,620
She fancies you a lot.

60
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,040
No, I've a date tonight. Some other time.

61
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,810
- Are you sure you want to do it?
- Yes!

62
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,230
Give me your passports.

63
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,620
Next!

64
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,690
Next!

65
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,770
Next one!

66
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,040
Hey, you! You! Sit down.

67
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,190
Lady, is this OK?

68
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,390
Get me a bigger one.

69
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,410
- A plain one, no need to be fancy.
- OK.

70
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,450
Hey! Put it down!

71
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,160
I said put it down.

72
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,450
Don't touch.

73
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,350
Give them some beer.

74
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,340
Check, please.

75
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,310
Sometimes I'll spend the night at May's,

76
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,310
To keep her parents from finding out...

77
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,400
I'd sneak down from the balcony.

78
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,240
I wonder if I'll be able to do this again.

79
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,050
OK!

80
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,060
- How much?
- $25.

81
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,480
Later, OK?

82
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,790
What are you doing? Go!

83
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,850
Come here.

84
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,350
Follow me, go check it.

85
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,070
Pack this as well.

86
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,280
OK, OK.

87
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,680
Come.

88
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,900
He's not here.

89
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,320
Do you know where he is?

90
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,410
No.

91
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,330
He left this for you.

92
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,010
The date on the can tells me
that I don't have much time left.

93
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,510
If I don’t find those Indians.

94
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,540
I'd be in deep trouble.

95
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,050
Why the raincoat?

96
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,550
I think it will rain.

97
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,320
Sometime, somehow,
I've started to be very cautious.

98
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,870
Every time I wear a raincoat,

99
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,170
I'll put on a pair of sunglasses as well.

100
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,120
One never knows when it's going to rain...

101
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,830
or when it'll be sunny.

102
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,880
Any message for account 368??

103
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,440
- Password please.
- Love you a million years.

104
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,090
Nothing for me?

105
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,350
No calls for you today.

106
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,430
Thanks.

107
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,440
I took it as a joke
when she said on April fool’s Day,

108
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,530
we would separate.
I decided to let the joke last for a month.

109
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,440
That's because May loves pineapples.

110
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,710
The first of May is also my birthday.

111
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,920
I promised myself that if May doesn’t change her
mind after I've bought 33 cans of pineapples...

112
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,350
From that day onwards,
I started to buy a can of pineapples

113
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,470
that'd expire on the first of May every day.

114
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,310
Then, our love will expire as well.

115
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,730
Sir, this can will expire tomorrow,

116
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,890
Let me change it for you.

117
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,320
This one is fine.

118
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,750
When is the first flight in the morning?

119
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,040
I'd like to make a reservation.

120
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,010
For one.

121
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,500
- Have you seen these people?
- No.

122
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,930
Look carefully, they're with their kids.

123
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,300
No.

124
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,510
- Have you seen these people?
- I don't know anything.

125
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,480
- Have you seen these people?
- No.

126
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,540
- And this? No?
- No.

127
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,270
- You really don't know?
- I've no idea where he is.

128
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,480
I saw you talking to him!

129
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,900
No...

130
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,020
Where's my daughter? What do you want?

131
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,430
I'll give you an hour.
If I don't hear anything by then...

132
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,680
you'll never see your daughter again.

133
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,830
An ice cream for her, please.

134
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,230
Daddy, Daddy!

135
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,700
Some people are willing to give up their children
for money.

136
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,000
He's not one of them.

137
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,120
An hour later, I left.

138
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,130
Police! Freeze!

139
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,610
I haven't busted any crime for six months.

140
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,720
Hands up!

141
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,910
But I run into this wanted man today.

142
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,130
Every time I solve a case,

143
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,200
I'll always want May to be the first to know.

144
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,170
Hello? Hello?

145
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,660
Bruce Willis, I'll kill you!

146
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,800
Any canned pineapples that expire
on the first of May?

147
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,180
Do you know what day is today?

148
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,690
- April 30th.
- Exactly.

149
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,140
You think we'll sell expired goods?

150
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,690
There are still two more hours to go.

151
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,700
No-one will want anything that's expired,
go get something fresh.

152
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,110
Fresh? What's so good about being fresh?

153
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,580
Do you realize how much effort has been put
into manufacturing a can of pineapples?

154
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,710
You have to grow them, harvest them, and slice them;
just to throw them away like that!

155
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,550
- Do you ever think of what these cans will feel?
- Buddy, I only work here.

156
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,550
Who cares about what these cans feel?
Have you ever thought of my feelings?

157
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,680
It's a blood and sweat job for me!

158
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,270
Of course I wish these cans never expired,
that would save me a lot of work!

159
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,530
You like expired canned food? Here you go.
Take as many as you like, it's on the house.

160
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,190
Somewhere, somehow,
everything comes with an expiry date.

161
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,370
Swordfish will expire.

162
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,960
Meat sauce will expire.

163
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,050
Even Glad Wrap will expire.

164
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,010
I wonder if there's anything in the world
that won’t expire?

165
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,220
Hey, you want some canned food?

166
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,560
It's expired! Keep it yourself.

167
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,070
You sure?

168
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,880
I finally found my thirtieth can of pineapples
in a store.

169
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,510
As the first of May begins.
I've come to realize something.

170
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,600
To May.
I'm no different than a can of pineapples...

171
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,810
You don't want this? It's very tasty... No?

172
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,770
Everyone says that dogs are man’s best friends.

173
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,270
Why does mine
refuse to share my sorrow at the moment?

174
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:42,390
I bet this must be some record.
I ate all thirty cans of pineapple that night.

175
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,310
Good thing May wasn't into durian...

176
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,070
How I wish to go out and celebrate!

177
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,030
May must have gone to bed now,

178
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,620
I wonder if the other May is asleep as well.

179
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,670
Why are you back?

180
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,560
I'm thinking of going to a Late-night movie.

181
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,690
May is gone.

182
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,190
Gone?

183
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,360
You think she'll wait for you?

184
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,750
Women can't afford to wait.

185
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,530
The more they wait, the more they get nervous.

186
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,750
Once they're nervous, they'll go nuts.

187
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:34,250
She went out with Richard.
You better be earlier next time.

188
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,880
It's hard to imagine that I've been dumped
by two Mays on a single night.

189
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,420
To heal my wounds,

190
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,650
I've decided to never go out
with another girl named May.

191
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,680
Lulu? This is Wu!

192
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,680
Want to come out for a drink?

193
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,100
Are you in bed already?
How can you sleep this early?

194
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,150
You're really going to sleep?

195
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,700
Nothing. Bye.

196
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:08,130
Hi, Chieko-san? Guess who I am? It's Wu.

197
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,340
Bingo. You're right.

198
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,840
Want to go out for a drink?

199
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,970
Your husband? When did you get married?

200
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,810
Five years already?

201
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,480
We haven't seen each other
for more than five years?

202
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,820
You have two kids already?

203
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,860
You're happy? Great!

204
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,490
OK, keep it up.

205
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,370
Is Jiang Xiuhui there?

206
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,880
This is He Qiwu.

207
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,630
I sat next to you in fourth grade.

208
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,430
Don't you remember?

209
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,550
Never mind. Goodbye.

210
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,690
All those pineapples made me feel terrible
in the stomach.

211
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,490
So I go to a bar,

212
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,660
thinking that the alcohol will help my digestion.

213
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,330
Are you OK?

214
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,490
Yes, yes. Another double whiskey.

215
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,840
There’s a song called
"Love Ends As The Sun Rises."

216
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,880
That's exactly how I'm feeling.

217
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,920
How can I forget May?

218
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,880
I promise myself, 

219
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,590
I'll fall in love with the first woman

220
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,760
who walks into the bar.

221
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,740
Miss, what do you want?

222
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,940
Whiskey, please.

223
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,760
I have a feeling that she’ll like me.

224
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,080
To make sure of that, I ask her a question.

225
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,170
Excuse me, miss. Do you like pineapples?

226
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,940
Bet she’s not a native speaker.

227
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,240
Excuse me, miss. Do you like pineapples?

228
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,450
Do you like pineapples?

229
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,010
May I know if you like pineapples?

230
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,440
You speak proper Mandarin.

231
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,470
I grew up in Taiwan. And you?

232
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,730
I'm not in a talking mood tonight.

233
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,980
Leave me alone.

234
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,360
We don't need to talk,

235
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,450
may I just sit next to you?

236
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,660
There are lots of seats here,
why must you sit next to me?

237
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,110
Because I can feel that you're Lonely.

238
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,470
Oh, yeah?

239
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,000
Yes.

240
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,470
There are only three reasons for a woman
to wear sunglasses at this hour.

241
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,800
She's either blind,

242
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,760
or she's a poser,

243
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,390
or she's fallen out of love and doesn't want
people to know she's been crying.

244
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,490
Which type do I belong to?

245
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,530
The broken-hearted.

246
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,660
It's no big deal, you don't have to cry.

247
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,500
I've fallen out of love too.

248
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,280
I would go jogging and sweat it out

249
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,500
so there will be no more water left for tears.

250
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,550
Want to go jogging?

251
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,430
I've been running for the whole evening
and I'm exhausted.

252
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,030
If you want somebody to talk to,
go find someone else.

253
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,060
I don't particularly want to talk.

254
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,560
Just want to keep you company.

255
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,600
I know too well what a broken heart feels like.

256
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,080
At her saddest moment, a woman
will need a man's shoulder to lean on to.

257
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,040
You may take me as your man.

258
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,090
I don't have a man.

259
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,590
I don't have a woman either.

260
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,430
How old are you?

261
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:27,020
I was 24 two hours ago.

262
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,100
Now I'm 25.

263
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,100
I won't like you.

264
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,360
Don't jump to conclusions.

265
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,650
We may get along with each other.

266
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,620
Do you like pineapples?

267
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,120
That's none of your business.

268
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,830
I'm just trying to learn more about you.

269
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,210
I was in love with a girl for five years

270
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,630
and we've just separated.

271
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,390
She said I didn't understand her.

272
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,060
That's why I want to find out more about you.

273
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,150
You won't know me.

274
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,110
You won't give me a chance, 
you may try to know me.

275
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,870
What kind of men do you like?

276
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,540
Knowing a person doesn't mean
you’ll be able to win his love.

277
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,670
A person changes.

278
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,590
He may like pineapples today,

279
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,890
tomorrow he’ll like something else.

280
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,470
Sir...

281
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,510
we're closing.

282
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,520
Closing?

283
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,520
Want to go jogging?

284
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,530
I just want a place to rest.

285
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,300
I never thought she really meant rest
when she said rest.

286
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,170
I watched two old movies on TV that night,

287
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,470
and had four chef's salads.

288
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,160
As the sun rises, I know it's time for me to go.

289
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,830
Before I leave, I take off her shoes for her.

290
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:22,710
My mother said
that women will get swollen feet...

291
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,730
.. from sleeping with their high heel shoes on.

292
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,080
She must have walked a lot last night.

293
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,610
A pretty woman like her
should always have clean shoes.

294
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,080
I was born at 6:00am.

295
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,580
Two more minutes and I'll be 25.

296
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,120
In other words. I've lived a quarter of a century.

297
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,040
To celebrate this historical moment,

298
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,890
I go jogging

299
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:18,150
to get rid of the excessive water in my body.

300
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,110
This makes me feel very happy.

301
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,770
When I leave the ball court,
I decide to leave my pager behind...

302
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,780
...because I know very well
that no-one is going to call me today.

"Love you a million years.”

306
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,780
Your friend in Room 702 says Happy Birthday.

307
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,170
On May 1, 1994,

308
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,290
a woman said Happy Birthday to me.

309
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,350
Because of this. I'll remember her all my life.

310
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,680
If memory can be canned,
I hope it will never expire.

311
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,700
If an expiry's date must be added onto it.

312
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,770
I hope it will be "a million years".

313
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,380
Get me a cigarette.

314
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,380
It's raining.

315
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,420
Oh, yeah?

316
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,230
A Coke, please.

317
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,270
Went jogging again?

318
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:21,320
A man like you can't jog all day.

319
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,990
Try Faye, she's a good girl.

320
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,040
Who's Faye?

321
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,530
Here's a tip for you, she just came today.

322
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:35,090
Act fast! Don't let Richard get there before you.

323
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,810
- Thanks a lot. I don't like men.
- Men?

324
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,900
Excuse me, excuse me.

325
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,770
At the closest point of our intimacy,

326
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,060
we were just 1 cm apart from each other.

327
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,940
I knew nothing about her.

328
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,520
6 hours later,

329
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,950
she fell in love with a man....

330
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,830
A chef salad, please.

331
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,300
For here or
to go?

332
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,330
To go.

333
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,530
Are you new? Never seen you before.

334
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,850
You like loud music?

335
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,560
Yes, the louder the better.

336
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,560
Then I don't have to think.

337
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,860
So you don't like to think?

338
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,370
What do you like?

339
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,330
Never thought about that.
I'll tell you when I've found out myself.

340
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,370
How about you? What do you like?

341
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,620
Chef salad.

342
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,160
Chief, a chef salad, please.

343
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,180
Chef salad again?

344
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,210
Don't you ever get fed up with that?

345
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,180
It's for someone else.

346
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,220
Your girlfriend?

347
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,680
So she really likes chef salad?

348
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,260
Maybe she's just used to it.
Never said she didn't like it.

349
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,570
Maybe she'll like to try something different.

350
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,940
Try fish and chips, it's good.

351
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,070
What if she doesn't like it?

352
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,190
Buy both and let her choose,

353
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,360
then you can't go wrong.

354
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,090
Won't that be a waste?

355
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:35,450
Doesn't cost you much.

356
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,870
It's always good to have a choice.

357
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,600
All right, one chef salad and one fish and chips.

358
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,790
Good...

359
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,640
Thanks.

360
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,570
Chief, one fish and chips, please.

361
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,660
See? I told you she'd like it.

362
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,620
Well, she should have told me
that she didn't like chef salad.

363
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:52,940
But you didn't give her any choice.

364
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,790
She'd have told you if she was given a choice.

365
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,600
Talking about a change of taste,
what about trying pizza tonight?

366
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,450
I'm not sure if she'd like it.

367
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,020
Simple.

368
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:10,740
Use the same trick: buy them both.

369
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,990
Doesn't cost you much.

370
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,160
- All right.
- OK.

371
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:25,350
Hi there. Want to try something different tonight?

372
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,380
How about a hot dog?

373
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,860
No, thanks, just a cup of black coffee will do.

374
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,230
- Your girlfriend doesn't want anything tonight?
- She left me.

375
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,650
Why?

376
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,740
She said she wanted to try something different.

377
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:46,490
Well, I guess she's right. There are just as many
choices with men as there are with food.

378
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,490
Maybe I should have stuck with chef salad.

379
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,260
No big deal.

380
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:58,090
How will she know you are the best
if she doesn't try something else?

381
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:02,120
She'll come back sooner or later. Relax.

382
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,300
Thank you.

383
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,580
On board every flight,

384
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,680
there’s always an air hostess
whom you’ll like to seduce.

385
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,180
This time last year, at 25,000ft above sea level,

386
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,220
I successfully seduced one.

387
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,000
Do you want a drink?

388
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:51,010
I thought we’re going to stay together
for a long time...

389
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,150
flying all the way like a plane with a full tank.

390
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,930
I never expected that it'll change course.

391
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,580
back coffee, please.

392
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,370
It's almost a week now. Has she come back?

393
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:49,870
Excuse me.

394
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,060
Well, maybe she really has a lot of choices.

395
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,550
Then get her out of your mind.
If she can have her choice.

396
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:03,220
..why can't you try something different too?
You can't go on drinking black coffee like that.

397
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,980
You don't just change like that.
Let's do that slowly.

398
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:12,130
I'm all right. Don't worry.

399
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,400
If you say so.

400
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,070
Excuse me,

401
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:56,000
is there a policeman who comes here
every night for a chef salad?

402
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:01,010
oh, you mean #633? He's off duty tonight.

403
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:03,500
I thought he's off on Saturdays.

404
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,760
He's changed shift. Didn't he tell you?

405
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:21,990
Can you give this to him when you see him?

406
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,420
No problem.

407
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,450
Thank you.

408
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:52,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

409
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,730
I've to go out for a while.

410
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,410
- What?
- I've to go out for a while.

411
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,450
OK....

412
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,740
We have to go out for a while.

413
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,920
What?

414
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,080
- We are taking off for a while.
- Where?

415
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,960
Where are you going?
-I'll be around...

416
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:54,260
Huh, how come you're alone tonight?

417
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,130
Huh?

418
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,260
Just you here tonight?

419
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,770
Everyone was here a minute ago

420
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,520
but they all rushed out
when they saw you coming.

421
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,400
Something wrong with me?

422
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:12,370
Nothing.

423
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,030
back coffee?

424
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,410
Thanks.

425
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,830
Last night...

426
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,840
There's a girl...

427
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,050
What?

428
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,020
I said there's a girl...

429
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,050
Can you turn down the volume?

430
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:49,540
A girl was here for you Last night.

431
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,490
She left a letter for you.

432
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,960
really?

433
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,340
Yeah... a flight attendant

434
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,050
- Don't you want to have a look?
- I'll finish my coffee first.

435
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,510
Hey, your letter.

436
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:44,100
Keep it for me. I'll get it some other time.

437
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,590
Chief.

438
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,420
How come it's you?

439
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,090
of course it's me.

440
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:13,260
Where's #633?

441
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,600
He's having his annual leave.

442
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,770
Annual leave?

443
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:19,600
Said he hurt himself with a pin.
He's staying home.

444
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,610
Injured by a pin?

445
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:29,790
Ever since she's left everything in the house
has become very sad.

446
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:32,240
Every night I'll have to woo them to bed.

447
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,840
Do you realize that you've lost a lot of weight?

448
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,760
You used to be cute and chubby.
Now you're so slim.

449
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,390
Why, you must have confidence in yourself.

450
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:57,860
I told you not to cry. When will you stop crying?

451
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,990
one must be brave.

452
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,960
Look at you. You're so shabby.
Can't even stand up.

453
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,910
Let me help you.

454
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:21,350
Feel better now?

455
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,890
Say something.

456
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,050
Don't be mad with her.

457
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,400
We all have our moment of doubt.

458
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,900
Give her a chance, OK?

459
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,540
Feeling Lonely?

460
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,170
Just a few days, now look how trashed you are.

461
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,090
Feeling cold?
Let me give you some warm.

462
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:55,760
Hi there.

463
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,930
Yes, I have. I have it all packed.

464
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:03,690
- Need some help?
- No, thanks. I can manage.

465
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,320
Excuse me, excuse me.

466
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,620
It's you. How come you're here?

467
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:17,210
Are you better now?

468
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,830
What do you mean?

469
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,340
They said you were injured by a pin.

470
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,840
Don't listen to their shits.

471
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,130
Where're you been lately?

472
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,510
- I changed shift.  This is my jurisdiction now.
- really?

473
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,190
Need some help?

474
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,360
great.

475
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:42,860
I'm leaving now.

476
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,040
This is heavy!

477
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,500
It's not that heavy today.

478
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:54,470
This is hard work for you.

479
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,500
All jobs are like that.

480
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,460
Why did you take this job?

481
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,930
The chief is my cousin.

482
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,350
He couldn't find anyone so he asked
for my help.

483
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,990
What're you done before?

484
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:11,020
oh, lots of things.

485
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,440
I want to save some money.

486
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:15,650
To study?

487
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,030
No, never thought of that.

488
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,990
I just want to enjoy life.

489
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,040
How? Where?

490
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:24,630
Anywhere...

491
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,670
California maybe.

492
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,170
Why California?

493
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:36,590
I said maybe. If it's no fun,
I can always go someplace else.

494
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,680
You like to travel?

495
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,060
Don't you?

496
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:45,310
I'm very easy-going.
I don't mind staying at one place.

497
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:53,240
Let's go together.
I've almost saved enough money.

498
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,580
We'll see.

499
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,080
Why are you always like that?

500
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,080
The letter is still with me.

501
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,420
I haven't got the time to pick it up.

502
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,810
Give me your address and I'll mail it to you.

503
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,850
Then it won't be lost.

504
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:14,850
OK....

505
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:42,350
...You're living in the neighborhood.

506
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:48,220
Yeah, just down the road.
Come and visit me sometime.

507
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,390
Sure, that'll be great.

508
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,900
Well, let's go.

509
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,820
You're sweating. Can you manage?

510
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:00,110
I'm fine.

511
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:59,690
Stop day dreaming, will you?
You think you're a superstar?

512
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,570
What are you doing with that carrot?
Who's going to eat that?

513
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,870
You want to sing? Use a toilet roll.

514
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,090
You too.

515
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,420
I'm not day dreaming.

516
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,340
You're right. You're not day dreaming.

517
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,630
You're sleep walking.

518
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,640
Sure... sleep walking

519
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:36,870
Whatever you say. Sleepwalking.

520
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,280
I had a dream that afternoon.

521
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:40,530
I seemed to have been in his house.

522
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:43,870
I thought I was going to wake up
when I left the house.

523
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,040
But I just realized that for some dreams.
you simply never wake up.

524
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,890
Sometimes I'll go home for lunch.

525
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:01,100
because returning home each time
offers another hope.

526
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,430
I know you're in there.

527
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,060
Come out now.

528
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:11,440
I'll count to three.

529
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:16,570
One...two...three.

530
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,420
She used to love to dive out from the closet
to scare me.

531
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:27,000
She doesn’t do it anymore. I know.
you can’t repeat the same game too often.

532
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,720
Can she be hiding in the washroom?

533
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,930
Hello...

534
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,060
Hello!

535
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,450
Stupid.

536
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,040
Sir, your roasted pork with rice.

537
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,080
Thanks.

538
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,090
Excuse me... excuse me.

539
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,510
It's you again.

540
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,600
That's right.

541
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:20,600
Will you be here for a while?

542
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:23,810
Why?

543
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,110
Nothing, nothing.

544
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,910
Hey, where are you heading?

545
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,650
I'm going back for something I've forgotten.

546
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:39,090
oh, yes, I still haven't mailed your letter.

547
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:40,540
No hurry.

548
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:43,460
You sure?
Then I'll send it later when I have time.

549
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:52,260
Hey, why are you back?

550
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:55,060
I'm in a hurry to pay the electricity's bill.

551
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,060
Can you look after this for me?

552
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:05,630
Cousin? I'm still at the marketplace.

553
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:06,990
What? You're still at the market?

554
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:09,660
It's pouring here.

555
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:14,130
Can you hear?

556
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:17,750
What are you talking about? It's shining here.

557
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:21,900
really? Must be an isolated shower.

558
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,470
I'll be back as soon as the rain stops.

559
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,180
Don't forget the electricity's bill.

560
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:27,310
Sure.

561
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:16,040
I'm going.

562
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:19,490
OK, I know. I'll come and visit you soon.
I will. Bye-bye.

563
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,850
This is for you.

564
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:49,320
Why so many lychee's?

565
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:51,860
They're for a friend.

566
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,090
Where are you?

567
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,790
I'm paying the electricity bill.

568
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:03,540
You're gone for hours.

569
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,100
There are a lot of people here.
I can't even squeeze in.

570
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,050
Guess I'll just have to wait.

571
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:12,290
It's impossible. How come it's always crowded?

572
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,990
How do I know?

573
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:20,150
I'll try my best.

574
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:22,820
Shall I come again tomorrow?

575
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:25,740
If it's that crowded, try someplace else.

576
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:27,780
Someplace else?

577
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:32,320
OK, I'll try, then. I'm really going to try now.

578
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,290
Hello...

579
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,630
Hi. You've been shopping?

580
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,460
No, it's for a friend. He's renovating his house.

581
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,260
You sure are busy.

582
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:46,300
Yes. Surely I am.

583
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:50,780
back coffee again? It's bad for your health.

584
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:53,770
Water is what you should have
if you can't sleep at night.

585
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,310
Hi. It's me.

586
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:20,410
I'm back to Hong Kong.

587
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:24,070
Want me to reserve a seat for you?
call me. It's the same number. Bye.

588
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,970
What beautiful hair!

589
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:20,810
How long have you grown it?

590
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,310
It's none of your business. Crazy woman.

591
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:28,020
Isn't she a bitch?

592
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,530
Yeah.

593
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,530
What?

594
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,330
Nothing...
Well, actually, do you know her very well?

595
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,540
Not really.

596
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:53,650
One day. I suddenly had this feeling
that she had returned.

597
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:26,510
I am not sure
if I've forgotten to turn off the tap

598
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,310
or if the house's been getting
more and more sentimental.

599
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:31,770
I've always thought that it's been
the strongest.

600
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,060
It's been crying a lot.

601
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:36,150
When a person cries,

602
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:38,780
you can simply give him a piece of tissue paper
to dry his tears.

603
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:40,610
But when a house cries,

604
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:46,110
you really got a lot of hard work to do.

605
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,390
Wow! How come you're here?

606
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,370
- This is my home, of course I'm here.
- Your home?

607
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:09,860
What are you doing here?

608
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,370
I come to buy goldfish.

609
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,740
- No-one sells goldfish here.
- No?

610
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:17,360
- You said you came here to buy goldfish?
- Yes.

611
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:19,370
Do you come here to buy or sell goldfish?

612
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,780
What are you trying to say?

613
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,880
Don't push me.
I can't remember a thing when I'm scared.

614
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,880
Why are you scared?

615
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,420
I don't know! I'm just scared of you.

616
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,930
I'm going now.

617
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,770
What is this? You're still standing here.

618
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,900
Don't rush me!
There's something wrong with my legs.

619
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,650
Are you having a cramp?

620
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:49,160
How do I know? I've never had one before.

621
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:52,450
Come in and take a rest.

622
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,840
Every time she returned from a trip.

623
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,600
I'll massage her legs.

624
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:09,890
Being an air hostess is no easy job.

625
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,680
I always think that women’s legs are very sexy.

626
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,900
I haven’t touched one since she left.

627
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,780
Feeling better?

628
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,480
Yes. Can I go now?

629
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:28,590
Stay for a while.

630
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:30,670
I'll play some music for you.

631
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:55,030
Do you like this song?

632
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:57,490
I don't care much for music.

633
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:59,530
It's my girlfriend's choice.

634
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,040
You sure she liked this song?

635
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:07,540
Yes.

636
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,470
I know his girlfriend doesn't like this song at all.

637
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,900
The CD was mine. I left it here a few days ago.

638
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,030
I was starting to wonder if sleepwalking
could infect to other people.

639
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,820
Wonder if I've been too nervous.

640
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,780
After a while I just fell asleep

641
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:58,190
The girl fell asleep in my house that afternoon.

642
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:01,570
I wanted to wake her up.

643
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:03,990
but for some reason I didn't do that...

644
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,310
Shit!
Shit!

645
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,250
Watch out with the fire.

646
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,380
Watch out! Handle the candles with care.

647
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:56,140
It's all your fault. What's wrong with you lately?

648
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:58,270
Why didn't you pay the electricity's bill?

649
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,310
Where have you been every day?

650
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,230
To see the doctor.

651
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,190
Doctor? I don't see you talking any medicine.

652
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:10,650
of course I did. You just didn't notice.

653
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:14,870
really? Did the doctor tell you
when you'll recover?

654
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,820
It won't take long.

655
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,840
Idiot!

656
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:40,950
I wonder if it's the weather or what.

657
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:43,520
Lately. I've found that I've changed a lot.

658
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,450
I've become more observant.

659
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:49,030
I start to notice a lot of things
which I never paid attention.

660
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,790
Even sardines are tasting differently.

661
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:52,450
My mother was very pretty in her youth.

662
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:55,410
You mustn't give yourself up.

663
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:58,580
How can you have grown so fat
in such a short time?

664
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:03,790
Even if she's gone,
you still have to carry on with yourself.

665
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:07,550
You mustn't indulge yourself any more.
Control your diet.

666
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,470
Do you know how you've disappointed me?

667
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:14,090
You've changed so much.

668
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:16,420
one mustn't change one's personality.

669
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:20,690
You mustn't change yourself,
even if she's not coming back any more.

670
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,230
You really have to reflect on this.

671
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:33,000
When I see it cry. I actually feel relieved.

672
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:37,880
Despite the change of its look.
it still remains true to itself.

673
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:40,920
It is still an emotionally-charged time.

674
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:46,210
Haven't you noticed
that I've become more optimistic??

675
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:50,240
I've found that many things are looking better.

676
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,350
You, for example, were a little dumb.

677
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:56,140
You mustn't make yourself so dirty though.

678
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,280
You used to be so much cleaner.

679
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:02,420
And look at these yellowish stripes.

680
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,790
Have you been fighting with others?

681
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,790
But you look a lot more cute now.

682
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:19,180
Why are you hiding here?
I've been looking all over for you.

683
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:24,810
It's useless lying here.

684
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,310
have to accept reality.

685
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,200
You're starting to smell too.

686
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:39,160
Let's go sunbathing tomorrow.

687
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:27,470
What are you doing in my house?

688
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:29,640
You asked me to visit you sometime.

689
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,560
Open up. 
hurry!

690
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:10,060
Someone's looking for you.

691
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,190
- Me?
- That's right.

692
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:18,490
Wow! 
Why are you here?

693
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,620
I've come for my letter.

694
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,790
What letter? Ask the chief

695
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:25,750
You've been keeping it.

696
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,590
- He says it's with you.
- Me? Where?

697
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,590
really?

698
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:35,720
oh, yes.

699
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:42,140
I'm just afraid that it'll be lost.
I swear I haven't read it.

700
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:48,490
Thanks.

701
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,950
Will you be free tomorrow evening?

702
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:54,440
Why? What do you want?

703
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:55,980
I want to take you for a date.

704
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:59,940
- Why do you want to date me?
- The manager said you'll be off tomorrow.

705
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:04,530
Why should I need a date for a day off?

706
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,740
You think about it.

707
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:11,010
I'll wait for you at the California Restaurant
tomorrow night at 8.

708
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,060
This song doesn't suit you.

709
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,270
Listen to this.

710
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,420
Shit!
Oh shit!

711
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:43,460
Didn't know #633 was so good with girls.

712
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,680
- It's #633, Chief!
- Get out of here...

713
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:57,490
hold... hold on a second. I haven't got...

714
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:59,530
Chili sauce. Here, here. OK?

715
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,410
Coke, please.

716
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:03,700
What?

717
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:06,210
Coke, please.

718
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,710
Coke.. the paper cup ran out...

719
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:13,510
- Mutton.
- Mutton? Ha!

720
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:20,960
I cleaned up the house that afternoon.

721
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:25,940
It's like clearing up the runway
for the next flight.

722
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:06,240
I arrived at the California a little earlier
that evening.

723
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:09,490
Since I didn’t know how long the flight
will be delayed.

724
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:11,660
I decided to get some loose change.

725
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:26,050
Some loose change, please.

726
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,710
Half an hour later.
I got some more loose change.

727
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:51,210
I had a feeling that the flight might have been
canceled.

728
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:17,410
She won't be coming.

729
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:19,500
She asked me to give you this letter.

730
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:25,000
No need to be sad though.

731
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:27,510
Try another one.

732
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,300
May is a good girl. She'll be coming back to work
tomorrow. Try her.

733
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,980
Where is she?

734
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:37,810
She's quit. She said she's going to California.

735
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:41,020
That's all.

736
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,520
Thanks.

737
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,530
I didn't open the letter.

738
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,070
There are things that you need time to accept.

739
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:54,760
After the manager left.

740
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,920
I started talking to the beer bottles.

741
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,300
Disappointed?

742
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,260
Not really.

743
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:06,010
Go home and sleep. She’s not coming.

744
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,530
She did indeed go to California that evening.

745
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:22,420
It's just that it's the other California.

746
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:25,160
That same evening.
we were at two different California's.

747
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:27,620
separated by a time difference of 15 hours.

748
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:31,630
It should be 11 am now in California. USA.

749
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:37,880
I wonder if she will remember
that I have a date with her at 8pm.

750
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:56,490
What a coincidence!

751
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,700
You're off tonight?

752
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,000
Yes.

753
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,470
How are you?

754
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:08,380
Still the same. And you?

755
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:10,510
Not bad.

756
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,980
You alone?

757
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:14,680
I'm with a friend.

758
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:20,600
Good match.

759
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:25,070
You still have some stuff at my place.
When will you pick them up?

760
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:30,350
Don't want them anymore. Throw them away.

761
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,660
OK

762
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:38,540
Got to go now.

763
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:45,510
- I still think you look better in your uniform.
- You too.

764
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:47,640
- Bye.
- Bye.

765
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:52,770
- You haven't paid.
- You pay for me.

766
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:25,720
How much, please?

767
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:10,270
The letter turned out to be a boarding pass.

768
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,360
The date, however, was a year later.

769
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:16,220
I missed the destination
it was blur.

770
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:32,100
I did go to the restaurant that night.

771
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:35,050
I knew it would be crowded by 8.
So I arrived at 7:15.

772
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:37,550
It was pouring that evening.

773
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:41,850
Thorough the window. I saw a raining California.

774
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:47,620
I wanted to know desperately if the other
California is warm and sunny.

775
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:49,940
I decided to give myself one year's time.

776
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,940
Today the rain is just as heavy as that day.

777
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:58,790
Looking out of the window.
I only have one person in mind.

778
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:02,830
I wonder if he had ever opened the letter.

779
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:02,450
Why are you here?

780
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:11,850
- Why are you here?
- How come it's you?

781
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:14,840
What are you doing here?

782
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:16,300
Refurbishing.

783
01:37:16,350 --> 01:37:18,390
Refurbishing?

784
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:20,850
Where's my cousin?

785
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:23,730
He's opened a karaoke.

786
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:27,520
He said he wanted a change.

787
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:29,690
and let me take over.

788
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:31,780
Didn't he tell you?

789
01:37:31,870 --> 01:37:34,860
I haven't seen him.

790
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:38,160
He's really got a business sense.

791
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:42,510
First he sold me the fish and chips,
and then the whole shop.

792
01:37:42,510 --> 01:37:43,960
What?

793
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:46,630
I said he's got a great business mind.

794
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:55,930
Since when are you into this kind of loud music??

795
01:37:57,650 --> 01:38:00,810
It takes a little time to get used to
and then it's fine.

796
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:03,440
Did you go to California?

797
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:04,940
- Was it fun?
- What?

798
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:18,030
Did you go to California? Was it fun?

799
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:22,760
California? Just the same. No big deal.

800
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,020
You look pretty good in uniform.

801
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:35,560
You look nice in this too.

802
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:37,570
Want to eat something?

803
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:39,580
Guess not.

804
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:42,860
I have an early flight tomorrow.

805
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:49,910
When will you be back?
I'm opening this in two days' time.

806
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:56,170
I don't know. This time it may take a while.

807
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,170
Well, write me a letter.
when you reach someplace.

808
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:08,490
You may not even read it.

809
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:11,650
Just want to ask you something.

810
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:26,880
Will you let a person board
with a boarding pass like this?

811
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:35,850
The date is today,

812
