00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,595
<i>You brush past</i>
<i>so many people every day.</i>

2
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,703
<i>Some you may never know</i>
<i>anything about,</i>

3
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:53,278
<i>but others might become</i>
<i>your friend someday.</i>

4
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,281
<i>I'm a cop.</i>
<i>My name is He Qiwu,</i>

5
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,010
<i>and 223 is my badge number.</i>

6
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,013
Move it!

7
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,454
Freeze!

8
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:12,961
Out of the way!

9
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,904
Hey!

10
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,688
<i>That was the closest</i>
<i>we ever got..</i>

11
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,987
<i>just 0.01 cm between us.</i>

12
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,089
<i>Fifty-seven hours later,</i>

13
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,995
<i>I fell in love with this woman.</i>

14
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,662
Hello? Ma'am?
This is Qiwu.

15
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,200
No, I called to talk to you,
not May.

16
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,935
How are you?

17
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,342
Oh, I'm fine.

18
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,678
Yes, best to let May
cool down for a while.

19
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,377
I'm sure she'll call
when she's ready.

20
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:12,992
Please don't tell her
I called, okay?

21
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,188
You're going to a movie?
I won't keep you.

22
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,160
Is your husband there?

23
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,436
Sir? This is Qiwu.

24
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,603
No, don't call May.
I just called to say hi to you.

25
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,438
Is your cough better?

26
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:38,243
You're rushing out?
I won't keep you then. No, it's all right.

27
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,148
Is May's sister there?
No?

28
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,789
How about her other sister?
I just wanted to say hi.

29
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,949
<i>We all have our habits.</i>
<i>Mine is to wait here</i>

30
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,458
<i>for May to get off work.</i>

31
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,123
<i>The boss here says she looks like</i>
<i>Yamaguchi Momoe. She likes that.</i>

32
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,268
<i>She and I just broke up.</i>

33
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,303
<i>She wished I were more like</i>
<i>Tomokazu Miura myself.</i>

34
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,440
Message for account 368?

35
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,711
Password is
"Love You for 10,000 Years."

36
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,681
Call Ming?
You mean May?

37
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,511
Spell it.

38
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,986
M-I-N-G? It's not M-A-Y?

39
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,090
Sure there's no mistake?
You're sure?

40
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,359
Don't you know English?

41
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,925
Ming? I knew it!

42
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,299
I guess May asked you to call.

43
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,636
I'm fine.
Tell her not to worry, okay?

44
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,277
I'll take good care of myself.

45
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,438
But tell her she can call
anytime she wants.

46
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,914
No reason to bother you.

47
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,745
She didn't tell you to call me?

48
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,981
Then why did you page me?

49
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,184
You're jogging?
Did you get dumped again?

50
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,322
No?
Then why go jogging?

51
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:02,062
A race?
You've lost your mind!

52
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,999
Jogging is private.
You don't jog for an audience.

53
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,900
Forget it. Bye.

54
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,335
<i>We all get our hearts broken</i>
<i>sometime.</i>

55
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,641
<i>Whenever I do, I go jogging.</i>

56
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,518
<i>The body loses water</i>
<i>when you jog,</i>

57
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,212
<i>so I don't cry as easily.</i>

58
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,254
<i>I can't be crying.</i>

59
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:29,088
<i>May always thought</i>
<i>I was a cool guy.</i>

60
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,228
Still no go with your girlfriend?

61
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,335
It's been a month.

62
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,431
Find someone else.

63
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,369
How about May here?
She's not bad.

64
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,644
She's off early tonight.
Ask her out.

65
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,582
She has a crush on you.

66
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,881
Can't.
I have a date tonight.

67
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,717
Some other time.

68
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,170
Is this one okay, miss?

69
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,868
Get a bigger one,
but nothing fancy.

70
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,632
Give them some beer.

71
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,994
Check, please.

72
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,397
<i>Sometimes I'd spend</i>

73
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,199

<i>wouldn't find out,</i>

74
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:05,035

76
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,997
- How much?
- $2,500.

77
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,674
These too.

78
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,555

79
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,990

99

Sir, this can expires tomorrow.

100
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,515
Why don't you get another one?

101
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,313
It's all right.

102
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,792
What time's
your earliest flight tomorrow?

103
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,654
I want to reserve a seat.

104
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,527
One person.

105
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,321
- Have you seen these people?
- No.

106
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,225
Look carefully.
They have kids with them.

107
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,299
I really don't know.

108
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,275
- You really don't know him?
- No, I don't.

109

If you don't have some news
within an hour,

115
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,167
you'll never see
your daughter again.

116
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,651
An ice cream for her, please.

117
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,544
Papa!

I'll kill you, Tomokazu Miura!

128
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,072
You have any pineapple
that expires on May 1?

129
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,270
- What's the date today?
- April 30.

130
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,974
That's right.
Think I stock outdated goods?

131
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,986
There's still two hours to go.

132
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,851
Nobody wants stale goods.
Get a fresh can.

133
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:50,961
With you people it's always
"Out with the old, in with the new!"

134
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,357
You realize what goes
into making a can of pineapple?

135
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:58,025
The fruit is grown, harvested, sliced..
and you just throw it away!

136
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,194
How do you think
the pineapple feels?

137
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,273
Buddy, I just work here.

138
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,104
Who cares about the pineapple?
What about how I feel?

139
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,247
I stock and restock
this stuff all day.

140
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,350
I wish it would never expire.
It'd save me loads of work.

141
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,347
<i>Having an expiration date?</i>

142
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,990
Have a whole case on the house.

143
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,792
<i>When did everything start</i>

144
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,363

00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,293
<i>Swordfish expires.</i>
<i>Meat sauce expires.</i>

146
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,064
<i>Even plastic wrap expires.</i>

147
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:39,510
<i>I'm starting to wonder: Is there</i>
<i>anything in this world that doesn't?</i>

148
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,738
Buddy,
how about some swordfish?

149
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,984
It's expired.
I don't want it.

150
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,415
You don't want it?

151
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,160
<i>I finally found my 30th can</i>

152

155
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,950
<i>I'm no different</i>
<i>from a can of pineapple.</i>

156
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,781
You don't want any?
It's delicious.

00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,287
<i>People say dogs</i>
<i>are man's best friend.</i>

158
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:15,482
<i>So how come mine</i>
<i>won't share my grief now?</i>

159
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,977
<i>This must be</i>
<i>some kind of record.</i>

160
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,484
<i>I ate all 30 cans that night.</i>

161
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:48,159
<i>Good thing for me</i>
<i>that May wasn't into durian.</i>

162
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,487
<i>I feel like going out</i>
<i>and celebrating.</i>

163
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,926
<i>May's probably in bed by now.</i>

164
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,431
<i>But what about that other May?</i>

165
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,203
What brings you back here?

166
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,981
I'm thinking of going
to a late movie.

167
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,348
She's long gone.

168
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:18,887
Gone?

169
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:22,720
You thought she'd wait around?
Women can't afford to.

170
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,829
The longer they wait,
the more nervous they get.

171
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,965
Drives them crazy.

172
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,465
She just left with Richard.

173
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,263
You gotta move quickly.

174
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,103
<i>I never dreamed</i>

175
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,107
<i>two Mays could dump me</i>
<i>in one night.</i>

176
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,938
<i>To get over it, I resolve</i>

177
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,012
<i>never to go out</i>
<i>with another May.</i>

178
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,944
Hello? Lulu?

179
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,016
This is Qiwu.

180
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,244
Want to come out for a drink?

181
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,816
You're in bed already?

182
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,185
This early?

183
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,190
You were asleep?

184
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,563
Never mind. Bye.

185
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,501
Hello?

186
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,501
Guess who.

187
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,033
Bingo!

188
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,635
Want to come out for a drink?

189
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:19,042
Your husband won't let you?
When did you get married?

190
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,580
Five years ago?

191
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,586
We haven't seen each other
in over five years?

192
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,848
You have two kids?

193
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,658
You're happy.
That's great.

194
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,128
Well, all the best.

195
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,993
Bye.

196
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,804
Is Kong Siu-Wai there?

197
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,801
This is He Qiwu.

198
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:52,040
We went to fourth grade together.
You remember?

199
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,645
You don't?

200
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,847
Doesn't matter. Bye.

201
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:37,560
<i>Those 30 cans of pineapple</i>
<i>had left me feeling queasy,</i>

202
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,788
<i>so I went to a bar.</i>

203
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,998
<i>I'd heard alcohol</i>
<i>can settle the stomach.</i>

204
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,287
Are you okay?

205
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:13,261
Fine. Another double.

206
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,638
<i>There's a song called</i>
<i>"Love Dies at Dawn."</i>

207
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,299
<i>That's how I feel now.</i>

208
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,537
<i>What can I do to forget May?</i>

209
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,772
<i>I tell myself I'll fall in love</i>

210
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,216
<i>with the first woman</i>
<i>who walks in.</i>

211
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,014
What can I get you?

212
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,749
Whiskey, please.

213
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,572
<i>I have a feeling she'll like me,</i>

214
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:00,074
<i>but just to be safe,</i>
<i>I decide to ask her a question.</i>

215
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,355
Excuse me, miss,
do you like pineapple?

216
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,719
<i>Maybe she's not Cantonese.</i>

217
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,930
Tell me, do you like pineapple?

218
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,514
Do you like pineapple, miss?

219
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,642
Your Mandarin's not bad.

220
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,118
I grew up in Taiwan.
What about you?

221
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,980
I'm not in the mood to talk.

222
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,092
Please leave me alone.

223
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,091
We don't have to talk.

224
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,322
Could I just sit here?

225
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,935
There are lots of seats.
Why do you have to sit next to me?

226
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,964
I can tell you're lonely.

227
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,501
Really?

228
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,208
Yes.

229
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:09,506
There are only three reasons
a woman would wear shades this late.

230
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:13,048
First, she's blind.

231
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,312
Second, she's a poseur.

232
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,150
Or third, she got jilted

233
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,555
and doesn't want people
to see she's been crying.

234
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,720
And which one am I?

235
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,489
The jilted woman.

236
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,499
It's okay.

237
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,899
It happens all the time.
Why cry about it?

238
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:38,509
I've been there too.
I usually go jogging.

239
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,940
I run until I work up a sweat.

240
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,808
Then there's no water left
for tears.

241
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,244
Wanna try it?

242
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,943
I've been running around
all night. I'm exhausted.

243
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,054
If you're looking to chat,

244
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,282
please find someone else.

245
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:58,184
I don't particularly
want to talk.

246
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,593
I just want
to keep you company.

247
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,868
I know how it feels
to have your heart broken.

248
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,400
A heartbroken woman
needs a shoulder to lean on.

249
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,612
You can pretend
I'm your boyfriend if you want.

250
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,108
I don't have a boyfriend.

251
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,306
And I don't have a girlfriend.

252
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,615
How old are you?

253
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,921
Two hours ago, I was still 24.
Now I'm 25.

254
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,529
I won't like you.

255
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,594
Don't be so sure.

256
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:38,463
Give me a chance.
We might hit it off.

257
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,230
Do you like pineapple?

258
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,537
What business is that of yours?

259
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,269
I'm just trying
to learn more about you.

260
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,675
I was involved
with a girl for five years.

261
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,449
But then she dumped me.

262
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,419
She said
I didn't understand her.

263
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,957
So I want to get to know you.

264
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,121
You'll never get to know me.

265
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:11,726
Fine.
Then try to get to know me.

266
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,996
What kind of man do you like?

267
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,974
<i>Actually, really knowing someone</i>
<i>doesn't mean anything.</i>

268
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,573
<i>People change.</i>

269
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,581
<i>A person may like</i>
<i>pineapple today</i>

270
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,016
<i>and something else tomorrow.</i>

271
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,781
Sir!

272
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,979
We're closing up.

273
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,823
They're closing.

274
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,296
Wanna go jogging?

275
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,958
I just want somewhere to rest.

276
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:42,049
<i>When she said "rest",</i>
<i>I didn't think she actually meant it.</i>

277
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,257
<i>That night, I watched</i>
<i>two old movies on TV</i>

278
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,724
<i>and had four chef's salads.</i>

279
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:11,769
<i>When the sun rose,</i>
<i>I knew I had to go.</i>

280
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:17,008
<i>As I was leaving,</i>
<i>I took off her shoes.</i>

281
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:22,210
<i>My mother used to say</i>
<i>a woman's feet swell up</i>

282
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,479
<i>if she sleeps in high heels.</i>

283
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,069
<i>She must have walked</i>
<i>a lot that night.</i>

284
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,607
<i>Such a pretty woman</i>
<i>should have clean shoes.</i>

285
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:58,473
<i>I was actually born</i>
<i>at 6:00 a.m.,</i>

286
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:02,016
<i>so I'll really be 25</i>
<i>two minutes from now.</i>

287
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,353
<i>I've spent a quarter of a century</i>
<i>on this planet!</i>

288
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:13,153
<i>To celebrate this historic moment,</i>
<i>I go jogging.</i>

289
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:18,430
<i>I'll get rid of my body's</i>
<i>excess water.</i>

290
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,428
<i>It feels good.</i>

291
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:27,074
<i>As I leave the track,</i>
<i>I decide to ditch my pager.</i>

292
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,444
<i>I know very well</i>
<i>no one's gonna call me today.</i>

293
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,729
Account 368.

294
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,870
<i>Password, please.</i>

<i>"Love You for 10,000 Years."</i>

296
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:32,300
<i>Your friend in room 702 says</i>
<i>happy birthday.</i>

297
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,711
Thank you.

298
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,282
<i>On May 1, 1994,</i>

299
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,050
<i>a woman wishes me</i>
<i>happy birthday.</i>

300
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:48,155
<i>Now I'll remember her</i>
<i>all my life.</i>

301
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,851
<i>If memories ever come in a can,</i>

302
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,657
<i>I hope that can never expires.</i>

303
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,695
<i>If it has to have a shelf life,</i>
<i>I hope it's 10,000 years.</i>

304
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,889
A Coke, please.

305
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,193
Jogging again?

306
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:20,967
Running around
isn't gonna solve anything.

307
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:24,981
Listen, Faye's not bad either.

308
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,009
Who's Faye?

309
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,046
Just started here today.

310
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:34,214
Make your move
before Richard beats you to it.

311
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,092
- I'm not into guys.
- Guys?

312
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,564
Coming through!

313
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,703
<i>That was the closest</i>
<i>we ever got..</i>

314
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,772
<i>just 0.01 cm between us.</i>

315
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,275
<i>I knew nothing about her.</i>

316
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,974
<i>Six hours later,</i>

317
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,272
<i>she fell in love</i>
<i>with another man.</i>

318
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,856
Chef's salad, please.

319
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,164
For here or to go?

320
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,735
To go.

321
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,903
You new here?
I haven't seen you before.

322
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,445
You like listening
to loud music?

323
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,784
Yes. The louder the better.

324
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,316
Keeps me from thinking so much.

325
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,529
You don't like to think?

326
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,557
What do you like?

327
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,497
I'll tell you when I find out.

328
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,799
And what do you like?

329
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,437
Chef's salad.

330
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,067
A chef's salad, boss.

331
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,073
Chef's salad again?

332
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,175
Aren't you tired of them yet?

333
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,436
- It's not for me.
- Your girlfriend?

334
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,482
Is that her favorite?

335
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,277
She never said it wasn't.

336
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:19,650
Maybe she'd like
something different for once.

337
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,088
Try fish and chips.
It's delicious.

338
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,319
What if she doesn't like it?

339
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,693
Get both and let her choose.

340
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,891
You can't go wrong.

341
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,764
- Isn't that wasting money?
- It's not that much.

342
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,497
It's good to give her a choice.

343
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,207
Okay. One chef's salad,
one fish and chips.

344
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:42,845
All right!

345
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,781
Thanks.

346
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,824
Fish and chips, please, boss.

347
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,522
See?

348
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,861
I told you she'd like it.

349
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,628
You were right.

350
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,295
She never told me
she didn't like chef's salad.

351
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,066
You never..

352
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,216
You never gave her a choice.

353
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,477
If you had,
she might have told you.

354
00:45:56,653 --> 00:46:00,714
Anyway, now you broke the routine.
Try pizza tonight.

355
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,057
I don't know
if she'd like pizza.

356
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:09,889
Then do the same thing:
Get both.

357
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,627
It won't break the bank.

358
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,395
Okay.

359
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:24,678
Want to try
something different again?

360
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,608
The hot dogs are good.

361
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,210
No, thanks.
Just black coffee.

362
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:33,088
Nothing for your girlfriend?

363
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,718
She left.

364
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,382
Why?

365
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,892
Said she wanted
to try some new dishes.

366
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,159
I guess she's right.

367
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,664
Plenty of choice in men,
just like food.

368
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,767
I guess I should've stuck
with the chef's salad.

369
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,838
It's no big deal.

370
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:57,845
She'll try someone else
and see you're better.

371
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:02,179
She'll come running back.
Don't worry.

372
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,717
Thanks.

373
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:30,643
<i>On every flight, there's one stewardess</i>
<i>you long to seduce.</i>

374
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,977
<i>This time last year,</i>
<i>at 25,000 feet,</i>

375
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,984
<i>I actually seduced one.</i>

376
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,979
<i>I thought we'd stay together</i>
<i>for the long haul,</i>

377
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,351
<i>flying like a jumbo jet</i>
<i>on a full tank.</i>

378
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,894
<i>But there was an unexpected</i>
<i>change of course.</i>

379
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,536
<i>Black coffee, please.</i>

380
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:48,209
<i>A week and she's not back?</i>

381
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,005
Excuse me.

382
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,844
Maybe she does have
lots of choices.

383
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,410
Then put her out of your mind.

384
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:00,681
You have plenty of choices too.

385
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:02,950
Black coffee every night's
no good for you.

386
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,729
Can't change just like that.
Have to go slow.

387
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,791
Don't worry.
I'll be okay.

388
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:14,196
If you say so.

389
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,609
Excuse me. The policeman who buys
a chef's salad here every night..

390
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,441
You mean No. 633?

391
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,742
He's off today.

392
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,112
Isn't he off on Saturdays?

393
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,722
He changed shifts.
Didn't he tell you?

394
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:22,227
If you see him again,
could you please give him this?

395
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,032
Sure, no problem.

396
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,674
Thank you.

397
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,395
Thank you.

398
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,364
I have to step out.

399
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,738
I have some things
to take care of.

400
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:08,876
We're taking a break.

401
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,711
- Where are you going?
- I have to go out too.

402
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,022
You here alone tonight?

403
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:59,053
You here alone tonight?

404
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,129
Everyone was here a minute ago.

405
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,996
They ran off
just as you walked up.

406
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,238
Something wrong with me?

407
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,564
No.

408
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,877
- Black coffee.
- Thanks.

409
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:21,375
Last night..

410
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,919
some girl..

411
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,120
What?

412
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,815
Last night some girl..

413
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,019
Can you turn that music
down a bit?

414
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:48,035
A girl waited around
a long time for you last night.

415
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,573
She left a letter for you.

416
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,916
Really?

417
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,145
A stewardess.

418
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,757
- You wanna read it?
- After my coffee.

419
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,758
Hey, your letter!

420
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,900
Keep it for me.
I'll get it next time.

421
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,355
Hey, boss.

422
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,215
What are you doing here?

423
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:11,325
I'm on duty.

424
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,860
- Where's No. 633?
- He's on leave.

425
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,327
On leave?

426
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:19,730
Said he got hurt by a pin.
He's recuperating at home.

427
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,337
Hurt by a pin?
What's he talking about?

428
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,868
<i>Ever since she left,</i>
<i>everything in the apartment is sad.</i>

429
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:33,311
<i>I have to comfort them all</i>
<i>before I go to sleep.</i>

430
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,849
<i>You've lost a lot of weight,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

431
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,650
You were so chubby before.

432
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:43,182
Now look at yourself.
You're so skinny.

433
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:48,163
Have more confidence
in yourself.

434
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:57,937
I told you to stop crying.
How long are you going to cry?

435
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,271
You have to be strong.

436
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:04,743
You're so limp and shapeless.
Look at you.

437
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,580
I'll help you.

438
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,426
There.
Isn't that more comfy?

439
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,958
Why don't you say something?

440
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,135
Don't be mad at her.

441
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:31,137
We all have moments of doubt.

442
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,109
Give her a chance.

443
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,108
Okay?

444
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,410
<i>Feeling lonely?</i>

445
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,214
<i>You're a real mess.</i>

446
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:47,851
<i>You cold?</i>
<i>I'll warm you up.</i>

447
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,460
- Hello.
- How are you?

448
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,727
It's all ready.
Need any help?

449
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,497
It's not much. I'll manage.

450
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,536
Excuse me.

451
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,545
Pardon me.

452
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,046
- Hello.
- Oh, it's you.

453
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,310
Are you better?

454
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:18,715
Better?

455
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,452
He said you got hurt by a pin.

456
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,621
Don't listen to his nonsense.

457
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,165
You haven't been
around much lately.

458
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,564
I changed shifts.
I'm on this beat now.

459
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:34,862
Really?

460
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,370
- Want some help?
- Sure.

461
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:42,504
See you later.

462
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,051
It's so heavy!

463
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,243
It's light today.

464
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,251
Your job must be hard.

465
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:57,148
Work's never fun.

466
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,021
Why'd you take this job?

467
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,288
My cousin couldn't find
anyone else.

468
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:06,196
I'm just helping out for now.

469
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,534
What did you do before?

470
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,902
Lots of things.

471
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,069
I'm saving up.

472
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:15,870
To go to school?

473
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,380
Never thought of that.

474
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,516
I just want to enjoy life.

475
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,449
How? Where?

476
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,348
Anywhere.

477
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,078
Maybe California.

478
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,718
California?
Is it fun there?

479
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:36,059
I said maybe.
If it's not, I can move on.

480
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,096
You like to travel?

481
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:41,835
Don't you?

482
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,031
I can take it or leave it.

483
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:52,443
You can come with me.
I almost have enough.

484
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,113
We'll see.

485
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,284
Are you always like this?

486
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,253
You never came to get
that letter.

487
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,324
I've been busy.

488
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:09,597
Give me your address.
I'll mail it.

489
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,030
Otherwise it'll get lost.

490
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,125
Okay.

491
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,725
You live close by.

492
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:47,529
Yeah, right down there.
Drop by sometime.

493
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,296
I will.

494
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:53,571
Well, let's keep going.

495
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,109
You're really sweating.

496
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,042
Sure you can manage?

497
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:00,114
I'm fine.

498
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:57,405
<i>Stop daydreaming, will you?</i>

499
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,700
<i>Think you're a rock star?</i>

500
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:03,812
You've been fooling around
with that all day.

501
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,039
Who'd wanna eat it now?

502
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,479
Use a toilet roll or something.

503
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,614
You too!

504
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,390
I'm not daydreaming.

505
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,622
That's right.
You're sleepwalking!

506
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:28,093
That's right.
I'm sleepwalking.

507
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,197
Whatever you say.

508
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,437
I'm sleepwalking.

509
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,575
<i>I had a dream that afternoon.</i>

510
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,875
<i>It seemed I was</i>
<i>in his apartment</i>

511
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,383
<i>and that I'd wake up</i>
<i>when I left.</i>

512
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,886
<i>I didn't know you never wake up</i>
<i>from some dreams.</i>

513
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,828
<i>Some days I go home for lunch,</i>

514
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,525
<i>because there's always</i>
<i>a chance..</i>

515
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,898
I know you're in there.

516
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,099
Come on out.

517
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:10,908
I'll count to three.

518
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,548
One..

519
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,447
two..

520
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:16,642
three!

521
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,151
<i>She used to jump out</i>
<i>and scare me,</i>

522
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,791
<i>but she hasn't done it</i>
<i>much recently.</i>

523
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:26,122
<i>I guess games get old</i>
<i>after a while.</i>

524
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,732
<i>Maybe she's hiding</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

525
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,095
Hello.

526
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:43,236
Hello!

527
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:01,584
Dummy.

528
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,520
- Roast pork and rice.
- Thanks.

529
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,957
Excuse me.

530
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,196
Hi.

531
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,526
- Eating here again, huh?
- Yes.

532
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:20,767
Will you be here a while?

533
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,735
Why?

534
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:26,040
No reason.

535
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:31,846
Where are you going?

536
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,717
I forgot something.

537
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,925
Oh, I still haven't
mailed your letter.

538
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,687
No hurry.

539
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:43,889
All right.
I'll get around to it.

540
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,365
Why are you back?

541
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:56,136
I have to pay the electricity bill.
Can I leave this here?

542
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:03,210
Hello? Cousin?

543
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:05,786
I'm still at the market.

544
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,889
It's pouring rain here.

545
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,821
It's pouring. Listen.

546
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:17,432
What are you talking about?
It's sunny over here.

547
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,161
Really?
Must be a local shower.

548
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:23,271
I'll be back when it stops.

549
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:24,906
Don't forget
the electricity bill.

550
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,666
I won't.

551
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:13,980
I'm going now.

552
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,050
It's okay.

553
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:18,482
I'll be back to see you soon.

554
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:44,707
These are for you.

555
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:49,272
Why all the lychees?

556
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,553
They're for a friend.

557
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:58,883
<i>Where are you?</i>

558
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,061
Paying the electricity bill.

559
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,959
<i>All this time?</i>

560
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:06,431
It's packed here.
I can hardly get in the store.

561
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,092
I have to wait in line.

562
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:12,138
How come it's always so crowded?
You've been trying for days.

563
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,570
I don't want to.

564
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:22,515
I'm doing my best.
Should I try again tomorrow?

565
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,415
Try another store.

566
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,918
Another store?

567
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:32,019
Okay. You're sure?

568
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,561
Hi.

569
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,863
Been shopping?

570
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,803
A friend is redecorating
his place.

571
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:45,165
- You sure are busy.
- I certainly am.

572
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:50,542
Black coffee again.
It's bad for you.

573
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:53,805
If you can't sleep at night,
drink water.

574
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:31,345
<i>Man in my dreams</i>

575
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:34,954
<i>I hold you tight for a minute</i>

576
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:38,590
<i>And kiss you for hours</i>

577
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:46,358
<i>Stranger</i>

578
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:50,197
<i>You stole into my heart</i>

579
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:54,001
<i>And set it all awhirl</i>

580
01:11:56,879 --> 01:12:00,576
<i>I've been in love</i>
<i>with you before</i>

581
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:03,877
<i>But never felt so close</i>
<i>to you as now</i>

582
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:08,415
<i>My thoughts careen</i>
<i>out of control</i>

583
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,794
<i>Why have you taken me by storm</i>

584
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:19,559
<i>Bursting into my dreary dreams</i>

585
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,699
<i>Sending shock waves</i>
<i>in every direction</i>

586
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:47,020
<i>Man in my dreams</i>

587
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,688
<i>I want you to be real</i>

588
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:54,765
<i>My heart can no longer resist</i>

589
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:02,442
<i>Searching in my dreams</i>

590
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:05,136
<i>At this minute I'm waiting</i>

591
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:09,506
<i>To kiss you for hours</i>

592
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,150
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

593
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,619
<i>The plane's back in Hong Kong.</i>
<i>Want to make a reservation?</i>

594
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,782
<i>I'm at the same number. Call me.</i>
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

595
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:20,144
Nice hair!
Did it take long to grow?

596
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,374
None of your business.

597
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,615
Kind of a flirt, isn't she?

598
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,279
I guess so.

599
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,753
What is it?

600
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,596
Have you known her long?

601
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,233
No.

602
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:50,570
<i>One day I had this sudden</i>
<i>feeling she was back.</i>

603
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,006
<i>Did I leave the faucet running,</i>

604
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:30,015
<i>or is the apartment</i>
<i>getting more weepy?</i>

605
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,683
<i>I thought it would cope all right.</i>

606
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:34,822
<i>I didn't expect it</i>
<i>to weep this much.</i>

607
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:39,058
<i>When people cry,</i>
<i>you just give them a tissue.</i>

608
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:43,127
<i>But when an apartment cries,</i>
<i>it's a lot of work to mop it up.</i>

609
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,585
What are you doing here?

610
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,484
- I live here.
- You live here?

611
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:09,556
What are you doing here?

612
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:11,852
I came to buy goldfish.

613
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:15,356
- Someone around here sell goldfish?
- No.

614
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,761
Then why come to buy goldfish?
You buying or selling?

615
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,867
What? No..
I mean, I'm buying.

616
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:26,205
Stop it! I forget everything
when I'm scared.

617
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,569
Why are you scared?

618
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:30,871
I got scared
when I saw you here.

619
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,636
I'm going now.

620
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,379
You said you were going.
Well?

621
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:44,824
I can't move my legs.
I'd go if I could.

622
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,594
You have a cramp?

623
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:49,731
I don't know.
It's never happened before.

624
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:52,557
Maybe you should come in
and sit down.

625
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:06,411
<i>When she'd return from a long flight,</i>
<i>I'd massage her legs.</i>

626
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:08,981
<i>Being a stewardess</i>
<i>is a tough job.</i>

627
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,814
<i>I've always found</i>
<i>women's legs sexy.</i>

628
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:15,786
<i>But I haven't touched any</i>
<i>since she left.</i>

629
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:26,160
- Better?
- I guess.

630
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,461
- Can I go now?
- Stay a while longer.

631
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:30,561
I'll put on some music.

632
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,488
You like this song too?

633
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:58,758
Not really.
My girlfriend liked it.

634
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,933
She really liked this song?

635
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:07,171
Yes.

636
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,684
<i>I know it isn't true.</i>

637
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:22,514
<i>That's my CD.</i>
<i>I left it here a few days ago.</i>

638
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:27,718
<i>I'm starting to wonder:</i>
<i>Can sleepwalking be contagious?</i>

639
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,189
<i>I guess I've been too nervous.</i>

640
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,799
<i>After a while, I fell asleep.</i>

641
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:58,756
<i>The girl fell asleep</i>
<i>in my place that afternoon.</i>

642
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,952
<i>I thought about waking her up,</i>

643
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,223
<i>but for some reason I didn't.</i>

644
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:37,723
Oh, no!

645
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:43,832
Watch out for the flames.

646
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:48,134
Make sure
those candles are secure.

647
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,707
Don't burn yourself.

648
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:55,041
What's gotten into you lately?

649
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:58,618
Why didn't you pay
the electricity bill?

650
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:00,948
Where have you been
going every day?

651
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:03,715
I went to see the doctor.

652
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,390
The doctor? I haven't seen you
taking any medicine.

653
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:10,258
You just didn't notice.

654
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:14,628
Did he say
when you'd get better?

655
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:17,599
Should be any day now.

656
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:25,239
You're crazy!

657
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:40,792
<i>Maybe it's the change of season,</i>

658
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:43,226
<i>but lately I've changed a lot.</i>

659
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,628
<i>I've become more observant.</i>

660
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,530
<i>I notice things</i>
<i>I used to take for granted.</i>

661
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,865
<i>Even the sardines taste different.</i>

662
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,462
You mustn't let yourself go.

663
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:57,460
You were fine before.
Now you've suddenly put on weight.

664
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:03,104
She left,
but you have to carry on.

665
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:07,479
You can't go on
indulging yourself.

666
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:10,210
You know, I have to tell you:

667
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,845
You've totally changed.

668
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:15,821
You can't just
change personality like this.

669
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:19,987
Her walking out is no excuse.

670
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,328
I want you to think about that.

671
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:33,006
<i>It was a relief</i>
<i>when I saw it crying.</i>

672
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:35,972
<i>It may look different</i>
<i>on the outside,</i>

673
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:38,908
<i>but it's still true to itself.</i>

674
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,843
<i>It's still</i>
<i>a very emotional towel.</i>

675
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:43,344
Have you noticed
I've perked up?

676
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,486
Things are starting
to look better.

677
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:49,415
You used to look sorta dumb,

678
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,783
but now you're looking
quite cute.

679
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:56,123
But you mustn't
let yourself get so dirty.

680
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:58,993
You used to be
so clean and white.

681
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,901
Now you've turned all yellow.

682
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:05,005
Look at these scars.

683
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:09,941
Have you been
getting in fights?

684
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,780
Why were you hiding in there?

685
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,318
I've been looking
all over for you.

686
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:24,751
What's the point of hiding?

687
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:27,417
You have to face reality.

688
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:32,492
You're all moldy.

689
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:36,899
Tell you what.
I'm not busy tomorrow.

690
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:39,365
I'll take you out for some sun.

691
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:27,314
What are you doing
in my apartment?

692
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,719
You said to drop by!

693
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:36,161
Open up
or I'll break the door down!

694
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:09,723
There's someone
looking for you.

695
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:11,525
- Me?
- Yeah.

696
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,403
- What do you want?
- I've come for my letter.

697
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:22,668
What letter?
Ask the boss.

698
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:26,138
You were keeping it.

699
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:28,043
He said you had it.

700
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:29,444
I do?

701
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:33,076
I have it?

702
01:26:33,254 --> 01:26:34,881
Oh, right.

703
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:42,127
I was afraid someone might take it.
I didn't read it.

704
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:47,993
Thanks.

705
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:52,872
Are you free tomorrow night?

706
01:26:53,107 --> 01:26:55,007
Why do you ask?

707
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:57,474
- I want to ask you out.
- On a date?

708
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:00,079
The boss says
you're off tomorrow.

709
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:03,978
So I have to go on a date?

710
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:06,017
Think it over.

711
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:10,954
I'll meet you across the street
at the California at 8:00.

712
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:15,921
That music's not your style.

713
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:17,894
Here's your CD back.

714
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:32,541
Damn it!

715
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:36,545
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

716
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:42,718
No. 633
is a smooth operator.

717
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,825
- It's 663.
- Whatever it is!

718
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,066
Wait!

719
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,514
- Where's my Coke?
- I'm out of cups!

720
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,627
<i>I gave my place</i>
<i>a thorough cleaning that afternoon.</i>

721
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:25,664
<i>It was like clearing the runway</i>
<i>for another plane to land.</i>

722
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:07,463
<i>I got to the California</i>
<i>really early that night.</i>

723
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:09,803
<i>I half expected a flight delay,</i>

724
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:12,241
<i>so I got some loose change.</i>

725
01:29:24,592 --> 01:29:25,684
Change, please.

726
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:48,045
<i>Half an hour later,</i>
<i>I broke another $10 bill.</i>

727
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:51,918
<i>I started thinking</i>
<i>maybe the flight was canceled.</i>

728
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:17,206
She isn't coming.

729
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:20,108
She asked me to give you this.

730
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:24,712
Don't look so down.

731
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:28,014
She didn't work out,
so try another girl.

732
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:31,989
May's coming back tomorrow.
Give her a try.

733
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:35,519
- Where is she?
- She quit.

734
01:30:35,696 --> 01:30:37,926
Said she was going
to California.

735
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:40,397
That's all.

736
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,167
Thanks.

737
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:49,169
<i>I didn't read the letter.</i>

738
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:52,774
<i>Some things take time</i>
<i>to sink in.</i>

739
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:55,649
<i>After the snack-bar manager left,</i>

740
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:58,149
<i>I started talking</i>
<i>to the beer bottles.</i>

741
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:00,515
<i>Disappointed?</i>

742
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:02,850
<i>Not really.</i>

743
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:07,088
<i>Go home to bed.</i>
<i>She's not coming.</i>

744
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:19,905
<i>Actually, she wasn't</i>
<i>a no-show that night.</i>

745
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:22,269
<i>She just got the place wrong.</i>

746
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,104
<i>We were</i>
<i>in different Californias</i>

747
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:28,376
<i>15 hours apart.</i>

748
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:32,877
<i>It must be 11:00 a.m.</i>
<i>over there now.</i>

749
01:31:34,055 --> 01:31:37,616
<i>I wonder if she'll remember</i>
<i>our 8:00 p.m. date here.</i>

750
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:56,170
What a coincidence!

751
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:00,809
Not on duty tonight?

752
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:02,640
That's right.

753
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:05,879
How are you?

754
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,314
Fine. And you?

755
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:10,020
I'm okay.

756
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,925
You alone?

757
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,129
No, I'm with a friend.

758
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:19,792
He's your type.

759
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:23,229
You still have stuff
at my place.

760
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:25,037
Come get it sometime.

761
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:28,507
That's all right.
Just throw it out.

762
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,736
All right.

763
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:38,243
I gotta go.

764
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,921
I still think
you look better in uniform.

765
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:45,388
So do you.

766
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:51,222
Hey, you didn't pay.

767
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,661
You pay for me.

768
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:25,966
How much is it?

769
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:12,568
<i>The letter turned out to be</i>
<i>a boarding pass dated for one year later,</i>

770
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:15,474
<i>but I couldn't make out</i>

771
01:35:15,643 --> 01:35:17,270
<i>the destination.</i>

772
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:31,917
<i>I actually did show up</i>
<i>that evening.</i>

773
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:35,688
<i>I knew it would get crowded,</i>
<i>so I got there at 7:15.</i>

774
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:38,894
<i>It was pouring outside.</i>

775
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:43,435
<i>Watching through the window,</i>
<i>I saw a rainy California.</i>

776
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:48,235
<i>I needed to know if the other</i>
<i>California was warm and sunny.</i>

777
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:50,875
<i>I decided to give myself</i>
<i>one year.</i>

778
01:35:53,314 --> 01:35:56,283
<i>Tonight it's raining</i>
<i>as hard as it was then.</i>

779
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:58,584
<i>Looking out this window,</i>

780
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:01,153
<i>there's just one person</i>
<i>in my thoughts.</i>

781
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:05,216
<i>I wonder if he ever</i>
<i>opened my letter.</i>

782
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:03,047
What are you doing here?

783
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,385
Hey!

784
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:09,655
What are you doing here?

785
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:11,619
Is that really you?

786
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:14,717
Yeah.
What are you doing here?

787
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:16,123
Renovating.

788
01:37:16,597 --> 01:37:18,189
Renovating?

789
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:20,726
Where's my cousin?

790
01:37:21,702 --> 01:37:23,670
He opened a karaoke bar.

791
01:37:25,773 --> 01:37:27,741
Said he needed a change.

792
01:37:27,908 --> 01:37:31,002
He let me take over here.
Didn't he tell you?

793
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:34,475
No, I haven't seen him.

794
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:37,080
He's a shrewd businessman.

795
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:40,620
First he sells me
fish and chips,

796
01:37:40,788 --> 01:37:42,312
and then the whole shop.

797
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:43,888
What?

798
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:47,121
I said your cousin
is a shrewd businessman!

799
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:55,331
Since when do you like
this loud music?

800
01:37:57,404 --> 01:38:00,237
With a little time,
I get used to things.

801
01:38:02,009 --> 01:38:04,876
Did you go to California?
Was it fun?

802
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:17,180
Did you go to California?
Was it fun?

803
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:19,656
California..

804
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,528
was okay.
Nothing special.

805
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:31,970
You look good in uniform.

806
01:38:33,007 --> 01:38:35,407
You look nice like that too.

807
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:37,539
Want something to eat?

808
01:38:37,778 --> 01:38:39,405
I better not.

809
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:43,114
I fly out real early tomorrow.

810
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:47,444
When will you be back?

811
01:38:47,888 --> 01:38:50,413
My grand opening
is in two days.

812
01:38:52,293 --> 01:38:53,783
I don't know.

813
01:38:54,295 --> 01:38:57,264
This might be a long trip.

814
01:39:00,634 --> 01:39:03,102
Write to me when you reach
wherever it is.

815
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:08,237
You probably
wouldn't read it anyway.

816
01:39:10,811 --> 01:39:13,177
I have to ask you something.

817
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:25,815
Would you let someone board

818
01:39:25,993 --> 01:39:28,018
with a boarding pass like this?

819
01:39:32,933 --> 01:39:35,834
It's dated today,
but it got blurred in the rain.

820
01:39:36,503 --> 01:39:38,403
I can't tell

821
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:41,405
where it's taking me.
Do you know?

822
01:39:43,344 --> 01:39:44,834
No..

823
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,675
but I'll give you another one.

824
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:54,086
Great.

825
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:06,499
Where do you want to go?

826
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:11,501
Doesn't matter.
Wherever you want to take me.

827
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:22,500
